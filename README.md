# Age Detection
This repository is composed of a notebook, a README, and a dataset made of pictures located in the sub folders of the folder data.

In the notebook, we will use neural networks to detect the age range of subjects using a portrait of them.

The dataset is composed of 4 folders, separating subjects by their age range :
- age 6 to 20
- 25 to 30
- 42 to 48
- 60 to 98
